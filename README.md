## Description

Backend API for managing a personal blog, built with GraphQL, Node.js, Express, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## Tech Stack

- **GraphQL**: API query language
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **Prisma**: Database ORM for PostgreSQL
- **Docker**: Containerization platform

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20.15.1)
- Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd project-directory
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables:
   ```
   PORT=4000
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb
   # Add other environment variables as needed
   ```

4. Start Docker containers (PostgreSQL):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

6. Generate Prisma Client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

### Running the App

Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

### Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Configure your production environment variables in a `.env` file.
2. Build your Docker containers for production deployment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
   ```
3. Use a process manager like PM2 or systemd to manage your Node.js application in production.
